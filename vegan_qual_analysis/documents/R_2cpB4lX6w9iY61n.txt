Omnivore Until two months ago I had been vegetarian for 7 years. I started eating fish again after a relationship breakdown with my husband who is a staunch vegetarian of 15+ years. I can't explain the mechanics of it but whilst the thought of eating mammals and birds makes me feel queezy, I love the taste and texture of fish and seafood and feel more like myself when I allow it into my diet.
