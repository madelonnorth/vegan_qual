Vegetarian While I think it is healthy for humans to eat meat, I personally don't don't like the idea and have been vegetarian for 20 years now (although have felt this way as long as I can remember). I don't like the mistreatment of animals and mass production of meat. I try to eat ethically and sustainably.
