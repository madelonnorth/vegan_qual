Omnivore I grew up vegetarian but is difficult to maintain sufficient and nutrient-intake or healthy weight within my current budget if I exclude free food (which can sometimes include meat) or conviently accessible food of sufficent quality (less common, but given food allergies sometimes this means eating meat too).
