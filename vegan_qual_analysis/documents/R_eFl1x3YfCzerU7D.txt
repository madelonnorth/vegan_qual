Vegan Ethicality. I feel murder is immoral, and the process of torture and immense suffering these animals face is barbaric and unjustifiable. While there are counterarguments to these which propose that might is right and that such treatment is justified by processes of evolution - these reasons are insufficient when I look to the immensity of pain and suffering born out by animals and live with the recognition of my culpability and participation in this violence.
