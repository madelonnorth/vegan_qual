Omnivore I would say I more accurately eat a mostly vegetarian diet but I do eat chicken on a weekly basis. Eating meat (specially red meat) and eating any dairy has made me feel bloated, uncomfortable, and overall sickly. I prefer to eat what makes me feel better, but unfortunately itâ€™s easier for me to eat dairy, meat, and vegetables.
