Omnivore Having suffered from an eating disorder for over eight years (initially diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa in 2010, diagnosis changed to Anorexia Nervosa in 2016), I am reluctant to place further restrictions on my diet. I am currently in recovery- I have been fully weight restored for 9 months and am now only rarely using disordered behaviours. However, I am aware of the effect that dietary restriction has on me- any concrete rules around food tend to trigger cravings and binge/purge behaviour, and any dietary rules I put in place tend to become more rigid and restrictive over time. I think it would be very easy for disordered restriction to sneak back in under the disguise of healthy, ethical exclusion of food groups, and this is not a risk I am currently willing to take.
I have known many people who have become vegan during their recovery from an eating disorder, and have felt that in the majority of cases (though certainly not in all) the new rules and restrictions of veganism have replaced the rules and restrictions of their eating disorder, whether or not the individual concerned has been aware of this. Some acquaintances have become vegan with the conscious intent to use this to control their diet (as veganism excludes many food items with high fat or calorie content e.g. cheese, many baked goods, milk chocolate etc) and use lower calorie alternatives (e.g. soya or almond milk instead of dairy). I have also known people who genuinely believe that they are making a healthy choice by becoming vegan (either during their eating disorder or their recovery), but whose devotion to veganism has uncomfortably mirrored their previous devotion to their ED driven rules and rituals; as a result, food and their diet remains the central focus of their lives. At this point in my recovery I do not feel that I would be able to be completely honest with myself about my intentions if I were to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet.
