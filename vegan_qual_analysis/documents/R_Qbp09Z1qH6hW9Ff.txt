Vegan My body doesn’t react well on (red) meat. It causes bloating and constipation. I care about animal welfare, and do not want to contribute to animal cruelty. There are many alternatives available these days, so I do not need to consume animal products. Besides, I don’t particulary enjoy the taste of meat. I also care about the enviroment and feel like animal farming and fishing is harming our planet.
