Vegetarian Started being a vegetarian when I was 13 because I cared about animal welfare. At this point, I don't care too much but it has been five years so I stick with it for a few reasons: spite toward everyone who called it a phase, guilt that I feel whenever I seriously consider stopping, and because my body no longer knows how to process meat. I've gotten terrible stomach cramps every time I accidentally consume meat (including things made with animal broth). So it's just not worth it to stop.
