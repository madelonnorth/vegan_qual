Vegan A whole food plant based (no protein powders, no added/refined oils) vegan diet reduces chronic disease risk.  Plant protein sources are lower in methionine. So a diet that has adequate protein from legumes and other sources will have slightly less methionine.  Methionine mediates benefits seen in calorie restriction in the studying of aging.
