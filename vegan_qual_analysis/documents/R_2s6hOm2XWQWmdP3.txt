Vegan I was a volunteer at a local animal sanctuary as a teenager, run by a family of vegans. They made no attempts to influence me into being vegan, but did make literature and resources available to me in case I wanted to learn about it. The animal sanctuary mostly rescued farm animals, including ex-battery chickens. During my first such rescue, I had the unique opportunity to see first hand what those facilities are like. The sensory experience was overwhelming inside a battery shed; the intense heat from tens of thousands of animals all crammed into one space, the presence of flies and maggots everywhere and the unbearable smell of several tonnes of excrement and thousands of rotting chicken corpses was just awful. I couldnâ€™t reconcile that experience with my enjoyment of the taste of meat, dairy and eggs. I became vegan aged 12.
