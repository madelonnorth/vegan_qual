Vegan Primarily it is ethical, I believe to my core that no being should be used, mistreated and ultimately killed for a space on my plate.  After jumping down the rabbit hole and learning more about veganism and the plant-based “diet”, I have discovered so many other benefits.  The environmental destruction the factory farming industry causes is ultimately the leading cause of the most prevelant environmental issues we face on this planet.  By making small changes individually we can band together and make dramatic improvements to our world. This sense of unity ignites a true sense of purpose in a world where a lot can seem lost.  I believe finding purpose in doing my part to make the world a better place is the best decision I ever made.
