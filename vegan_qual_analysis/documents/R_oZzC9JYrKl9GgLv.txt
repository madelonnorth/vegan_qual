Vegan I’m against al forms of animal cruelty (clearly imprisoning and then eating them is cruel)
Re dairy - I’m not a baby calf or goat, was weaned off greasy milk early on in my life
We don’t “need meat”
Too much meat is linked to a variety of health issues including the top killers of our generation
I went vegan and have never felt better or been healthier: more energy, less sickness, ckeaeee skin, even my hair seems to grow better
