Vegan I believe we as humans have a responsibility to do our actions in ways which excludes unnecessary harm to non human animals, as I believe all animals have a right to live. We can and do in fact observe that animals do not want to die. In my opinion, factory farming, which is the most common method behind common store bought animal products, involves methods and treatments that in no way can be considered respectful of the animals, their well being and their interests. Following a vegan diet is also, at least as far as I am concerned, way more sustainable in regards to water usage and land area used, and can also easily be more nutritionally appropriate for humans. I must mention, though, that I am mainly vegan for the animals, and the other benefits are just added "bonuses".
