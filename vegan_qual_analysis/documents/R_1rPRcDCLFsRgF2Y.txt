Omnivore I was raised eating an omnivore diet which is the main reason although as an adult my diet has changed drastically, eating what I deem a healthy diet for me. Another huge reason is the availability of food of an omnivore diet, especially when eating out. There's such a huge range versus what can be a very limited vegan or even vegetarian range.
