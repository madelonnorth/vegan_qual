Vegan Ethical: all sentient animals deserve moral consideration and should therefore not be harmed for the taste of a meal when other nutritious foods are available and one can survive on a solely plant-based diet. 
Environmental: Animal agriculture has a large impact on the environment (soil and water eutrophication, air pollution, deforestation, and climate change). Also, it is energetical inefficient to feed nutritious plants to livestock first.
