Vegan 1) I follow the diet to mainly stop my contributions to animal cruelty or human induced suffering for animals.  
2) I consider going on the vegan diet to be also a part of my contribution to reducing the environmental impacts from animal husbandry. With the growing human population, I believe that it is not going to a sustainable process if we are higher on the food chain. And I can start with my own personal action.
3)I also understand that choosing to go lower on the food chain is more energy efficient in today's world when we have access to many types of grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits and greens. I've experienced multiple health benefits as well after transitioning to vegan from an omnivore diet
