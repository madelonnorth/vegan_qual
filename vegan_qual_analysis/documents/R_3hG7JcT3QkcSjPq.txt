Omnivore I was raised eating meat. When I was 20 I stopped eating meat and was a vegetarian for 2 years. I began feeling unwell (this lasted for 6 months) and doctors were unable to determine why and suggested I change my diet back to meat and see how I'm feeling. After being back on meat for a week I was feeling better and had much more energy. 
Initially I followed this diet because this is the diet I was raised on, but now I follow this diet for health reasons.
