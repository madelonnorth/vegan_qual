Omnivore Grew up on a farm, meat always available and slow stews taste great. I'm not growing anymore or ever going to menstruate so I could cut down on the meat consumption...  But I don't because I'm prone to low iron and supplementation of any sort is not my preference. I'm aware of the WHO statement on red meats but take it along with the fact too much of anything can be a bad thing. A varied diet of unprocessed foods is my ideal. I wouldn't consider a strict vegan diet because of how restrictive it would be on gatherings with family/friends.
