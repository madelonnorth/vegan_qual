Vegan Ethical reasons. Environmental reasons. The abuse the animals suffer in farming practices is horrific. The fact they are killed much earlier than their normal life expectancy is terrible. I also believe that eating plantbased is better for the planet. And also healthier for us. Can i point out that veganism is a lifestyle, not just a diet :)
