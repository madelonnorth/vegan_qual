Vegan Ethical and plain common sense.  Consuming animals or animal products is unnecessary in nutritional terms in all but the most extreme environments on the planet. Farming animals, aside from being environmentally unsound, involves tremendous suffering on a huge scale to those we have arbitrarily deemed not worthy of our compassion. Where there is an alternative, there is simply no reasonable justification for not following a vegan diet.
