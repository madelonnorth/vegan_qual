Vegan Being a vegan for me is not a diet. It’s not something you just do for a few months to loss weight. It’s a way of life. Everyday, all day forever. I truly believe it’s a much healthier way of living. I also don’t like to see any animal suffer for any reason. A cow or sheep is no different to a dog or cat. And should be treated with the same kindness and compassion.
