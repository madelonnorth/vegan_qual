Vegan I haven’t eaten meat in 6 years, I’ve always avoided it. I hate the taste and I hate the idea that I’m eating what was once a living creature. I’ve been vegan for 3 years as I educated myself on the benefits of eating a plant based diet. I believe that if I can access all of the nutrition that I need from plants then why would I take it from a living creature. I can’t say there’s one particular reason for me deciding to be vegan but all I know is that I’ll never eat animal products again.
