Vegan I stopped eating meat because there came a day where i decided to educate myself and start asking questions about farming and what happens behind the doors of a slaughterhouse. I thought quitting meat would also help a few health issues I was having, it didnâ€™t, and neither did surgery. A year or so later I went vegan, problem solved.
