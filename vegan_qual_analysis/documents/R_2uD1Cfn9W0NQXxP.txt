Vegan Animals are sentient beings and deserve to live just as much as we do. I also don't want to be consuming foods that are poisonous to my body and are damaging my health. I follow this lifestyle so my actions align with my morals. The animals are dying, we are dying and so is the planet simply because we murder and consume animal flesh and their secretions on an unfathomable scale. I want the animals to be safe, my body to be healthy and the planet to be cared for.
