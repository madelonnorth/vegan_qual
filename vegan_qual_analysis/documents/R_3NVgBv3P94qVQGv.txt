Vegan Animal welfare is the main reason for my choice of diet. I went vegetarian at the age 8, without ever meeting another vegetarian, I didn't even know the word for someone who doesn't eat meat, ai just knew that meat used to be an animal, and I didn't want to eat animals. I went vegan 3 years ago (having already cut dairy and eggs down drastically) as I made the connection that not only did I not want animals to die for my meal, I also didn't want them to be mistreated for it either.
