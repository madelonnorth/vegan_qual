Omnivore I do not like to follow this diet as I know it is unhealthy for me but I follow this diet because it is the most common diet being cooked in our country and apparently, there is no vegan restaurant here in my country that I know of. I tend to shift to being vegan but my whole family does not follow vegan diet therefore, i fall back to 
 the diet with mostly meat on it (because of "eat what is served").
