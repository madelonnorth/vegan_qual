Omnivore I was brought up this way and as adult I do not see any reasons to change it. I think we can help animals in different ways and not eating meat or other "animal based" products is not crucial. Moreover, substitution of meat and such products is not easy and requires thoughtful preparation in order to not deteriorate health.
