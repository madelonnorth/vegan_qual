Omnivore I believe in the environmental and ethical ideas behind vegetarianism and personally eat very little meat, but in a culture that, in my opinion, promotes extremes, black and white thinking, restriction, and ascribes moral value to people based on what they consume, I try to avoid any kind of rigidity in my diet. 
Besides, I am concerned about other issues (environmental concerns like transportation of food, pesticides, or unethical business practices of food conglomerates like human rights violations and unfair labor, and so many other things) that it would be impossible for me to eat only food consistant with my values. Why would I prioritize one cause over another? 
And finally because having had anorexia as a teenager, I appreciate the freedom of not having to think about what I eat, whether that's when I go out or in terms of nutrition (I know it's perfectly possible to have balanced vegan and vegetarian diets, but it does require just slightly more effort and awareness in terms of micronutrients that I don't necessarily want to invest thought in).
