Vegetarian At this point, it's mostly out of habit and because it helps the environment a bit. I've had a problem with my jaw since childhood that made eating meat difficult and I have a strong aversion to seafood so I never was a big fan of eating meat just because it could be painful for me. As I child I was often sick to the point where it impacted my grades because I was absent so much. My immune system was garbage. When I was a teenager, my parents went away for a trip and when left to cook for myself I unintentionally didn't have meat, dairy or eggs that week or so. I noticed I felt a lot better and decided to become a vegetarian since I felt better. I most likely have a food allergy of some sort to one of the foods that got cut out, but can't be bothered to get tested because I don't care enough. So here I am over 20 years later still a vegetarian with no real strong reason for it.
