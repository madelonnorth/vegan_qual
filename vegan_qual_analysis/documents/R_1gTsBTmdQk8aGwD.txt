Vegan Health and Moral reasons. 
There are plenty of non-animal options for meals in Australia and things are getting more accessible and user-friendly for Vegans to be able to easily maintain their dietary needs.
Science and researching has come along way informing us where to find safe nutrients needed in non-animal products. 

Thank you for asking the question and having the conversation.
