Vegan My girlfriend went vegan and so it was a bit awkward making meals together. Plus she always gave me wicked side eye when I would eat omnivorous meals..So decided to try it out to make her happy. And then I realised that I felt much healthier and wasn’t constantly bloated and constipated. Plus I’m an animal lover and couldn’t justify supporting animal cruelty while still identifying that way.
