Vegan Health, Environmental and Ethical reasons.
Eating animal products doesn't make me feel good physically: causes bloating, fogginess, constipation, acne, weight gain. 
I don't think it's healthy to eat animal products and I also don't want to directly contribute to the slaughter of animals and it's environmental impact.
