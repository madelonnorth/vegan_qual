Vegan I follow this diet because it is, based off of nutrition research, adequate for all stages of life to thrive and minimises harm to animals. Because I can buy food in the supermarket I think it would be unethical to buy animal products since they have no benefit other than taste preferance and seem to, based off of nutrition research, increase risk of some of our worst ailments.
