Vegan 1. Compassion. I couldn’t kill an animal and therefore, don’t believe that I should pay someone to do it behind closed doors for me and wrap it in cling film. The exploitation of animals in the dairy industry is also disgusting and shameful.
2. Health. I refuse to put meat in my system that is full of hormones.
3. The environment. We are killing this planet with our consumption of animal products.
