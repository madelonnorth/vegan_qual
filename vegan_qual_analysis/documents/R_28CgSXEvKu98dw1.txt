Vegetarian I believe that eating meat is unethical because of a number of reasons. mainly, the sentience of animals. we just don't know enough yet. the environmental impacts of eating animal products is also a contributing factor. i eat a mainly vegan diet however I say vegetarian as im still eliminating all animal products entirely. i still consume dairy if it's as a by product or as a part of work (im a barista)
