Vegan To prevent harm and death to animals, and minimise my support for the perpetrators of animal cruelty. 

To minimise my environmental footprint as animal agriculture is a huge polluter and waste of crops and land that could be used to fed people. 

To improve my health as animal products are proven to have extremely detrimental health impacts on the human body.
