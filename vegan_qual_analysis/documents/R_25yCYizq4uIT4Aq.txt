Vegan Mainly health benefits especially leading into Menopause, I also love that I don’t have to kill or harm animals to survive. My two daughters are vegan, up until 6 months ago I had been vegetarian for 30 yrs, they convinced me to go all the way and I don’t know why I didn’t go vegan earlier, I feel so good on a vegan diet 😁
