Omnivore I have difficulty keeping on weight, and it's generally easier to make sure I get enough calories and protein if I eat meat. I also just generally don't have any moral qualms with eating meat so I don't really see a reason not to. I don't have the energy or time or motivation to carefully figure out how to make sure I still get all the nutrients and fat and protein I need without any meat. Vegetarian and vegan diets tend to be in my opinion more expensive and more difficult to balance.
