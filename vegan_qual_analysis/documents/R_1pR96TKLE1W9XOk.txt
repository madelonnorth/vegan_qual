Vegan Mostly vegan. Vegetarian since in was 8 years old as I was/am a fussy eater, didn't like much meat and was constantly being told 'Either be vegetarian or eat meat, you can't pick and choose and being fussy'. Animal products have decreased throughout the years with periods of full veganism, however it has made me lose a lot of weight in the past so have then reverted to vegetarianism. An eating disorder probably influenced my food choices in different ways (binging, including dairy products and restricting dairy products. Learnt a lot about my ethics and nowadays supermarkets and food establishments make it so easy to be plant based, there really isn't any excuse. So much better for the environment and my health too.
