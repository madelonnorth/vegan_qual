Vegetarian Meat consumption is unparalleled as a human behaviour that is easy (high plasticity)  to reduce (if not extinguish), and where even a small reduction in consumption has huge impact on biodiversity. Such an obvious place to start.  One of my students (Matthew Selinske) is working on this too. Look him up, at RMIT. 

And also meat tastes yucky and I havenâ€™t eaten it since I was 12 (when my mum said I was allowed to use the stove).
