Omnivore Firstly I was raised as an omnivore so it's just something I'm used to and secondly it's easier to get hold of meat than substitutes.
Though since being diagnosed with lactose intolerance I have questioned why my body won't accept dairy and thought maybe I shouldn't eat meat or eggs either as it might not be good for our bodies to consume animal products, plus it's cruel and bad for the earth. I would love to go vegan as I understand what animals go through but living with IBS I have been advised by my gastro consultant and dietician to really limit my fibre intake which I would find hard to stick to as a vegan because it's a plant based diet. I have tried veganism a few times over the last few years but never managed to stick it out, simply because of flare ups because of fibrous vegan food and truthfully my cravings kick in after a few days for meat/fish/eggs - Perhaps because of deficiencies. It's always been while consuming a vegan diet when I have been unwell then diagnosed with B12 deficiency and folate deficiency. Then I get advised to increase my red meat intake (or green veg intake which is a no go because of the fibre content) but I'm not really a fan of red meat and it's expensive so I take a course of vitamins for a few months and I'm ok again. I prefer seafood but I understand this is also cruel and I hate seeing fishermen pose on photos holding a fish out of water, I see it suffocating. I don't miss dairy as I have found alternatives that are better than dairy - Even though most fake cheeses smell bad! Whereas I dont feel any meat or fish substitutes compare to real thing, except quorn chicken pieces and quorn sausages. I'm actually trying to put a meal plan together that's vegan and low in fibre. I think anyone can go vegan so long as it is tailored to their dietary needs for their personal health.
