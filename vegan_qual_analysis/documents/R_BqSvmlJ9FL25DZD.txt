Vegan I am vegan for ethical reasons, believing it is abhorrent and immoral to kill and exploit animals for food. I am also an environmentalist and believe a vegan way of living is the most sustainable. I am also health conscious and am aware a whole foods, plant based diet is the best for human health.
