Vegan I started for environmental and health reasons, but now my main motivator is ethical - I don't believe sentient beings who feel pain should be raised, abused, and killed for human consumption because it is morally wrong.  I continue to feel strongly about the positive environmental and health effects that a vegan diet has to offer.
