Vegan To save the world. To save water wastage, to save greenhouse gasses but mainly so animals don’t have to go through torture just so we can consume them on the daily. Babies getting taken from mothers just so the farmers can take all the mothers milk, the babies then being raised till their old enough to kill, hanging chickens by their feet and cutting the whole body off except their feet... how disgusting does that sound? I don’t want to be apart of the group of people that contribute to that.
