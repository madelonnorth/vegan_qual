Omnivore,"Taste, nutrition, family compatibility, history"
Omnivore,"As a child and a young adult living at home with my parents and siblings, I ate meat as part of almost every evening meal. Having baby-boomer parents, it was just the way most people ate back then. I still enjoy eating meat, but on fewer occasions each week than when I was growing up."
Omnivore,"I'm a low meat eating omnivore. I eat a small amount of ethically sourced meat at home, and when I dine out I eat a fair bit of vego/vegan food if I don't know where my meat is coming from."

Science and researching has come along way informing us where to find safe nutrients needed in non-animal products. 

Thank you for asking the question and having the conversation."
Omnivore,"I was raised eating meat. When I was 20 I stopped eating meat and was a vegetarian for 2 years. I began feeling unwell (this lasted for 6 months) and doctors were unable to determine why and suggested I change my diet back to meat and see how I'm feeling. After being back on meat for a week I was feeling better and had much more energy. 
Initially I followed this diet because this is the diet I was raised on, but now I follow this diet for health reasons."
Vegan,"Animal welfare, health, environmental sustainability"
Omnivore,To get all the nutriton needed

Vegan,"Ethical, and the animals"
Omnivore,"I was raised eating an omnivore diet which is the main reason although as an adult my diet has changed drastically, eating what I deem a healthy diet for me. Another huge reason is the availability of food of an omnivore diet, especially when eating out. There's such a huge range versus what can be a very limited vegan or even vegetarian range."

Vegan,"Primarily it is ethical, I believe to my core that no being should be used, mistreated and ultimately killed for a space on my plate.  After jumping down the rabbit hole and learning more about veganism and the plant-based “diet”, I have discovered so many other benefits.  The environmental destruction the factory farming industry causes is ultimately the leading cause of the most prevelant environmental issues we face on this planet.  By making small changes individually we can band together and make dramatic improvements to our world. This sense of unity ignites a true sense of purpose in a world where a lot can seem lost.  I believe finding purpose in doing my part to make the world a better place is the best decision I ever made."

Vegan,I initially started following a plant-based diet due to environmental / sustainability concerns. I would now also say that I am against exploitation of animals so would include that in the reasons.
Vegan,"1. Compassion. I couldn’t kill an animal and therefore, don’t believe that I should pay someone to do it behind closed doors for me and wrap it in cling film. The exploitation of animals in the dairy industry is also disgusting and shameful.
2. Health. I refuse to put meat in my system that is full of hormones.

Vegan,Eating animal products is terrible for the environment
Vegan,"Ethical, environmental"
Vegan,Initially for health reasons but have become more aware of environmental and animal cruelty
Vegan,"Because I realised that my consumption of animal products conflicted with my values for animal-welfare and the environment (less so for personal health). I disengaged my morals from meat eating by falling back on certain justifications (nice/normal/necessary etc.) but when I saw a video that broke down each of these justifications,  I could no longer fall back on them and had to change my diet."

I’ve been vegan for 3 years as I educated myself on the benefits of eating a plant based diet. I believe that if I can access all of the nutrition that I need from plants then why would I take it from a living creature. I can’t say there’s one particular reason for me deciding to be vegan but all I know is that I’ll never eat animal products again."

Vegan,"Health, environment and because i care about animals"
Vegan,"I watched the documentary called Lucent and I cried for an hour 20 minutes while I watched it, from that moment I can't eat the flesh of an animal, from there I watch documentrys on dairy and eggs and that lead to starting a vegan diet. I do have chickens and ducks, and we do eat their eggs."

Ethics
Sustainability
Health"
Vegan,"I follow a belief system and not a diet. If I followed a diet then I would say that I have a plant based diet. I am vegan beacause I do not believe that animals should be used for food, clothing, cosmetics or entertainment. My main concern is factory farming of animals."
Vegan,"I’m against al forms of animal cruelty (clearly imprisoning and then eating them is cruel)
Re dairy - I’m not a baby calf or goat, was weaned off greasy milk early on in my life
We don’t “need meat”
Too much meat is linked to a variety of health issues including the top killers of our generation

Vegan,"Not to contribute to animal cruelty
For health reasons
Because I prefer the taste of plant-based diet. I find the taste of animal products revolting"
Vegan,Animal Welfare Concerns
Vegan,"Ethical - reduce animal suffering
Environmental- reduce environmental impact
Health - increase immunity and general wellbeing"
Vegan,"Animal welfare is the main reason for my choice of diet. I went vegetarian at the age 8, without ever meeting another vegetarian, I didn't even know the word for someone who doesn't eat meat, ai just knew that meat used to be an animal, and I didn't want to eat animals. I went vegan 3 years ago (having already cut dairy and eggs down drastically) as I made the connection that not only did I not want animals to die for my meal, I also didn't want them to be mistreated for it either."
Vegan,"Animal Welfare
Climate Change impact
Health impact"
Vegan,"I try to make ethically conscious choices and to me, that involves avoiding the consumption of animal products to the best of my ability."
Vegan,No animal wanna die /suffer
Vegan,"To begin with, it was for ethical reasons however once I got deeper and deeper its for health and environmental reasons as well!"
Vegan,"Because I don't think us humans have a right to enslave and exploit animals to produce food that we do not need to survive. It causes enormous and unnecessary suffering to the animals, it destroys the environment and is detrimental to our health. It's just plain unethical."
Vegetarian,Mosto the enviroment but also animal right and health
Vegan,"Animal Rights,environment, health"
Vegan,"Mainly ethical purposes regarding animal rights, but also health and environmental reasons"
Vegan,I started my vegan diet 8 years ago due to concerns about the morality of killing animals. However today I follow a vegan diet more-so for the environmental concerns about animal agriculture.
Vegan,For the animals
Vegetarian,"The animals mostly, with a little bit of environmental stuff thrown in, that and I do not yet have the courage i need to go fully vegan"
Vegan,"Ethical and plain common sense.  Consuming animals or animal products is unnecessary in nutritional terms in all but the most extreme environments on the planet. Farming animals, aside from being environmentally unsound, involves tremendous suffering on a huge scale to those we have arbitrarily deemed not worthy of our compassion. Where there is an alternative, there is simply no reasonable justification for not following a vegan diet."

Vegan,I don't need to eat animal products and I value animals lives over my taste buds. Also the environmental impact.
Vegan,Because the treatment of animals in animal agriculture is horrifying to me
Vegan,"Ethical reasons. Environmental reasons. The abuse the animals suffer in farming practices is horrific. The fact they are killed much earlier than their normal life expectancy is terrible. I also believe that eating plantbased is better for the planet. And also healthier for us. Can i point out that veganism is a lifestyle, not just a diet :)"
Vegan,"Ethical, environmental and health"
Vegan,"Ethical, health, sustainability"
Vegan,"Ethical mainly, I don't agree with slaughtering an animal for food.  I also believe a vegan lifestyle is good for the planet and your health."
Vegan,For the animals & conseqently the planet.
Omnivore,Creature of habit. Was raised on it.
Vegetarian,I was raised vegetarian (on a wheat and sheep farm!) and my primary reason for choosing to be vegetarian (and vegan at least four days every week) is in relation to animal rights and welfare.
Omnivore,Basically my upbringing and lack of knowledge
Vegan,animal welfare
Vegan,"Primarily as a result of research into reducing risks of chronic disease and early death.  More broadly now, animals and environmental factors as well"
Vegan,"Health, animals, environment, society, justice and balance"
Vegan,"Ethical reasons, i.e. not causing unnecessary harm to animals. Environmental reasons, as animal product consumption is the leading cause for climate change and destruction of the natural world."
Vegan,"At first it was ethical reasons but now health reasons as well, as I have seen the benefits firsthand."
Vegan,"For the animals, my health and the environment."
Vegan,Because animals don't deserve to be murdered and abused for a selfish reason like tastebuds
Vegan,"Animals are not slaves, products or food"
Vegan,Ethical
Vegetarian,Because I don’t want to eat dead animals and I haven’t gotten through the transition to vegan yet
Vegan,Kindness. Animal ethics. Health. Environment.
Vegan,Veganism is not a diet. It is an ehtical lifestyle choice. I do not eat animals flesh or animal derived products because it is insanely cruel and we do not need to eat animals to live a healthy life.
Vegetarian,Meat industry and intensive farming are cruel for the animals and totally unsustainable. I chose not to be a part of it two years ago.
Vegan,"Health, ethical, environmental"
Vegan,"Mainly ethical, but I appreciate the environmental aspects as well."
Vegan,"Due to environmental issues, animal cruelty and health"
Vegan,Using and harming animals in any way is immoral. Humans have no right to use animals. Veganism is the only moral diet. Veganism is also healthier and better for the environment.
Vegan,To stop animal cruelty and to not participate and fund different industries that make a living off doing so. Animals perspective is always put first 🙏🏽
Vegan,"Healthier 
But definitely for the animals mostly they don’t deserve to die under those circumstances just for us to “eat” them 
"
Vegan,"For the animals, for my health and for the planet"
Omnivore,What I was brought up on
Vegan,I am concerned about animal welfare and impact that my diet has on the planet. I believe humans can survive healthily and using less resources by being vegan. I also find that veganism keeps me viewing the world with a compassionate lens. It helps me to eliminate disassociation and investigate more.
Vegan,To not fund animal cruelty
Omnivore,Because that's what I grew up eating although I have previously tried to be vegetarian however I found I can get iron deficient/anaemic without eating red meat so it never lasts.
Vegetarian,"Environmental reasons, I was vegan for two years, and now vegetarian for a year after struggling with health."
Vegan,"I follow this diet because it is, based off of nutrition research, adequate for all stages of life to thrive and minimises harm to animals. Because I can buy food in the supermarket I think it would be unethical to buy animal products since they have no benefit other than taste preferance and seem to, based off of nutrition research, increase risk of some of our worst ailments."
Vegan,Do not agree with human arrogance towards controlling the lives of other living beings and commercialising the slaughtering and torture of such animals. Neither do I respect the lack of responsibility for those who buy animal products without the emotional energy exchange of killing the animal themselves.
Vegan,"Don't want to contribute to the harm of an animal in any way, environmental and health"
Vegan,"For health reasons I choose not to eat meat & Dairy. My body and mind feel better when I cut these foods out of my diet.

I do still eat and love honey though so i wouldn't be considered a ""proper vegan"""
Vegan,Animal cruelty and reducing my environmental impact
Vegan,"Initially due to the compassion to animals and the suffering they endure, then through this I learnt about the destruction to our planet."
Vegan,It started asenvironmwntal reasons and quickly became for ethical reasons.
Vegan,Initially it was a moral decision as I discovered more and more of how farm animals are realistically treated. But I have remained vegetarian and then vegan for environmental reasons as regularly consuming meat and animal products is a truely unsustainable choice. The overall health benefits are a bonus.
Vegetarian,"Choice, and I lived with a Vegetarian for 10yrs when I was 19 and it was easier to not cook meat."
Vegan,Animal ethics & health benefits
Vegan,"Health,  ethics,  conservation of the environment"
Vegan,"1) I follow the diet to mainly stop my contributions to animal cruelty or human induced suffering for animals.  
2) I consider going on the vegan diet to be also a part of my contribution to reducing the environmental impacts from animal husbandry. With the growing human population, I believe that it is not going to a sustainable process if we are higher on the food chain. And I can start with my own personal action.
3)I also understand that choosing to go lower on the food chain is more energy efficient in today's world when we have access to many types of grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits and greens. I've experienced multiple health benefits as well after transitioning to vegan from an omnivore diet"
Vegan,"No inflamation in plant based, ethical love of animals"
Vegan,"Ethical, health and environmental reasons"
Vegan,"Being a vegan for me is not a diet. It’s not something you just do for a few months to loss weight. It’s a way of life. Everyday, all day forever. I truly believe it’s a much healthier way of living. I also don’t like to see any animal suffer for any reason. A cow or sheep is no different to a dog or cat. And should be treated with the same kindness and compassion."

Vegan,"For ethical reason. I believe animals are not ours for food, clothing, entertainment ect"
Vegetarian,I feel it's more ethical.
Vegan,"It began environmentally, 
Later came ethical and health."
Vegan,"It's better for the environment, and probably better for my health too.

The production and consumption of plant foods (as opposed to animal products) is significantly less harmful to the Earth and the sentient creatures who live on it.

At this point in my life, it makes more sense for me to avoid all animal products, and try to live in the most sustainable and least harmful way possible."

Omnivore,"Until two months ago I had been vegetarian for 7 years. I started eating fish again after a relationship breakdown with my husband who is a staunch vegetarian of 15+ years. I can't explain the mechanics of it but whilst the thought of eating mammals and birds makes me feel queezy, I love the taste and texture of fish and seafood and feel more like myself when I allow it into my diet."
Vegan,My girlfriend went vegan and so it was a bit awkward making meals together. Plus she always gave me wicked side eye when I would eat omnivorous meals..So decided to try it out to make her happy. And then I realised that I felt much healthier and wasn’t constantly bloated and constipated. Plus I’m an animal lover and couldn’t justify supporting animal cruelty while still identifying that way.
Vegetarian,Brought up vegetarian and for ecological reasons
Vegan,"Originallyethical reasons, but after seven years, I just have gotten used to it and it is hardly inconvenient in the place where I live"

Omnivore,"Crohn’s disease. Many plant proteins, as well as excessive amounts of fiber, I have trouble digesting. Often leads to bloating, gas, cramps, and stomach pain. I wish I could be vegetarian or vegan and have tried to maintain a pescatarian diet."
Vegetarian,"Meat consumption is unparalleled as a human behaviour that is easy (high plasticity)  to reduce (if not extinguish), and where even a small reduction in consumption has huge impact on biodiversity. Such an obvious place to start.  One of my students (Matthew Selinske) is working on this too. Look him up, at RMIT. 

And also meat tastes yucky and I haven’t eaten it since I was 12 (when my mum said I was allowed to use the stove)."

Vegan,"Because I can consider all lives before my own.  
For health,  for animal welfare,  for compassion, for world hunger, for peace and for the environment.  
It is not necessary for me to use or cause pain in this life."
Omnivore,"Firstly I was raised as an omnivore so it's just something I'm used to and secondly it's easier to get hold of meat than substitutes.
Though since being diagnosed with lactose intolerance I have questioned why my body won't accept dairy and thought maybe I shouldn't eat meat or eggs either as it might not be good for our bodies to consume animal products, plus it's cruel and bad for the earth. I would love to go vegan as I understand what animals go through but living with IBS I have been advised by my gastro consultant and dietician to really limit my fibre intake which I would find hard to stick to as a vegan because it's a plant based diet. I have tried veganism a few times over the last few years but never managed to stick it out, simply because of flare ups because of fibrous vegan food and truthfully my cravings kick in after a few days for meat/fish/eggs - Perhaps because of deficiencies. It's always been while consuming a vegan diet when I have been unwell then diagnosed with B12 deficiency and folate deficiency. Then I get advised to increase my red meat intake (or green veg intake which is a no go because of the fibre content) but I'm not really a fan of red meat and it's expensive so I take a course of vitamins for a few months and I'm ok again. I prefer seafood but I understand this is also cruel and I hate seeing fishermen pose on photos holding a fish out of water, I see it suffocating. I don't miss dairy as I have found alternatives that are better than dairy - Even though most fake cheeses smell bad! Whereas I dont feel any meat or fish substitutes compare to real thing, except quorn chicken pieces and quorn sausages. I'm actually trying to put a meal plan together that's vegan and low in fibre. I think anyone can go vegan so long as it is tailored to their dietary needs for their personal health."
Vegetarian,"- Discomfort with the idea of eating a another living being
 - Reducing environmental impact
 - Reducing animal suffering"
Vegetarian,Ethical
Vegan,"Mainly ethical reasons, but also environmental, and partly health"
Vegan,"I believe we as humans have a responsibility to do our actions in ways which excludes unnecessary harm to non human animals, as I believe all animals have a right to live. We can and do in fact observe that animals do not want to die. In my opinion, factory farming, which is the most common method behind common store bought animal products, involves methods and treatments that in no way can be considered respectful of the animals, their well being and their interests. Following a vegan diet is also, at least as far as I am concerned, way more sustainable in regards to water usage and land area used, and can also easily be more nutritionally appropriate for humans. I must mention, though, that I am mainly vegan for the animals, and the other benefits are just added ""bonuses""."
Vegan,"Reasons include: animal cruelty, factory farming of animals, environmental impact, vegan diet with b12 supplements provide all requirements for health, ethically aligns with my beliefs."

Vegan,"A whole food plant based (no protein powders, no added/refined oils) vegan diet reduces chronic disease risk.  Plant protein sources are lower in methionine. So a diet that has adequate protein from legumes and other sources will have slightly less methionine.  Methionine mediates benefits seen in calorie restriction in the studying of aging."

Background"
Vegan,"I was a volunteer at a local animal sanctuary as a teenager, run by a family of vegans. They made no attempts to influence me into being vegan, but did make literature and resources available to me in case I wanted to learn about it. The animal sanctuary mostly rescued farm animals, including ex-battery chickens. During my first such rescue, I had the unique opportunity to see first hand what those facilities are like. The sensory experience was overwhelming inside a battery shed; the intense heat from tens of thousands of animals all crammed into one space, the presence of flies and maggots everywhere and the unbearable smell of several tonnes of excrement and thousands of rotting chicken corpses was just awful. I couldn’t reconcile that experience with my enjoyment of the taste of meat, dairy and eggs. I became vegan aged 12."
Omnivore,"I would say I more accurately eat a mostly vegetarian diet but I do eat chicken on a weekly basis. Eating meat (specially red meat) and eating any dairy has made me feel bloated, uncomfortable, and overall sickly. I prefer to eat what makes me feel better, but unfortunately it’s easier for me to eat dairy, meat, and vegetables."
Vegan,Ethical reasons
Vegetarian,Moral and health reasons. Working on transitioning to veganism.
Omnivore,Balance
Vegan,"For the animals, for my health and for the environment."
Vegan,"Ethical: all sentient animals deserve moral consideration and should therefore not be harmed for the taste of a meal when other nutritious foods are available and one can survive on a solely plant-based diet. 
Environmental: Animal agriculture has a large impact on the environment (soil and water eutrophication, air pollution, deforestation, and climate change). Also, it is energetical inefficient to feed nutritious plants to livestock first."
Omnivore,"Poor self-control and lack of time - otherwise, I’d be vegetarian or vegan."
Vegetarian,"Environment (reduced water use and GHG emissions)
"
Omnivore,It’s what has always worked for me
Omnivore,No real reason
Vegetarian,"To not eat unethically treated animals, to help the environment, to improve my health, and to save money."
Omnivore,Financial situation
Vegan,"I started for environmental and health reasons, but now my main motivator is ethical - I don't believe sentient beings who feel pain should be raised, abused, and killed for human consumption because it is morally wrong.  I continue to feel strongly about the positive environmental and health effects that a vegan diet has to offer."
Omnivore,"I believe in the environmental and ethical ideas behind vegetarianism and personally eat very little meat, but in a culture that, in my opinion, promotes extremes, black and white thinking, restriction, and ascribes moral value to people based on what they consume, I try to avoid any kind of rigidity in my diet. 
Besides, I am concerned about other issues (environmental concerns like transportation of food, pesticides, or unethical business practices of food conglomerates like human rights violations and unfair labor, and so many other things) that it would be impossible for me to eat only food consistant with my values. Why would I prioritize one cause over another? 
And finally because having had anorexia as a teenager, I appreciate the freedom of not having to think about what I eat, whether that's when I go out or in terms of nutrition (I know it's perfectly possible to have balanced vegan and vegetarian diets, but it does require just slightly more effort and awareness in terms of micronutrients that I don't necessarily want to invest thought in)."
Vegetarian,"Health benefits, reducing my environmental impact, and moral reasons."
Omnivore,"Never given much thought to diet, I eat whatever's available and appealing."
Omnivore,I was raised omnivore and have not had a desire to change.
Vegetarian,"Ethical/Environmental beliefs primarily, with the discovery of a major health anomaly playing a secondary role in adopting a healther more natural diet."
Vegan,Ethical and health
Omnivore,I was previously anorexic and my dietitian taught me how to eat a balanced diet based on Australian guidelines
Vegetarian,"To help animal cruelty, climate change/the environment, and my health."
Vegetarian,To reduce suffering.  The fact that the planet and my health benefit as well is terrific but not why I started.
Vegetarian,"At this point, it's mostly out of habit and because it helps the environment a bit. I've had a problem with my jaw since childhood that made eating meat difficult and I have a strong aversion to seafood so I never was a big fan of eating meat just because it could be painful for me. As I child I was often sick to the point where it impacted my grades because I was absent so much. My immune system was garbage. When I was a teenager, my parents went away for a trip and when left to cook for myself I unintentionally didn't have meat, dairy or eggs that week or so. I noticed I felt a lot better and decided to become a vegetarian since I felt better. I most likely have a food allergy of some sort to one of the foods that got cut out, but can't be bothered to get tested because I don't care enough. So here I am over 20 years later still a vegetarian with no real strong reason for it."
Vegan,"Ethical, environmental and health"
Omnivore,"I feel this is the best diet for me, nutritionally balanced & the most delicious. I do not eat a huge amount of meat, I often have nice vegetarian meals too. When I eat meat, it is usually red meat with high iron, as I have low iron."

I follow this lifestyle so my actions align with my morals.

Vegetarian,I don’t like meat
Omnivore,I don't like restricting myself and feel I am actually more healthy consuming a diet with a good mix of meat and veggies.
Vegetarian,Health reasons
Vegetarian,ethics/morality
Omnivore,"I was vegan but switched and began eating
meat again because my life partner eats a lot of meat (and hates vegetables). It also makes it easier for me to get enough protein in my diet."
Vegetarian,"I am ethically opposed to the suffering of animals, and believe that it is hypocritical to eat farm animals when we would never (and it is illegal to) harm our own domestic animals."
Omnivore,Feel like meat would be too hard to give up
Omnivore,"Taste, lack of moral conviction"
Vegan,"1. To reduce cruelty to animals
2. To reduce harm to the planet
3. for good health"
Vegetarian,How i grew up
Vegetarian,Was raised vegetarian (moral/religious value based)
Omnivore,Good question
Vegetarian,"I enjoy the food more than meat, and my digestion is happier when I don’t eat meat. Reducing harm to the environment and to the animals themselves are added bonuses."
Vegetarian,Primarily ethical reasons. I find it hard to detach myself from my empathy for animals like most omnivores. I also swing between vegan and vegetarianism (depending on how stressed I am) more stressed = less dedication to veganism

Omnivore,I eAt mostly vegetarian but indulge in meat occasionally. I have been eating less meat recently for environmental reasons
Vegetarian,"Moral and environmental reasons- I think killing/harming animals for food is wrong, and my enjoyment of meat was never proportional to the environmental/life cost of it"
Vegan,Mainly the ethical implications. With the environmental benefits to a whole good vegan diet being the second reason and the personal health benefits a third reason.
Omnivore,"I think vegetarianism/veganism are ethical choices but prefer meat both for taste and nutrition.  Though I am an omnivore, I keep my consumption of beef and pork to a very low level (usually less than once a month for either) but eat tuna every day.  I was a vegetarian for about 7 years"
Omnivore,Health and taste
Omnivore,"I like it, it’s balanced, gets best health outcomes for me, doesn’t require special effort"
Vegan,Hhj
Omnivore,"Personal preference, lifestyle"
Omnivore,"I was brought up this way and as adult I do not see any reasons to change it. I think we can help animals in different ways and not eating meat or other ""animal based"" products is not crucial. Moreover, substitution of meat and such products is not easy and requires thoughtful preparation in order to not deteriorate health."
Vegetarian,"Ethical concerns (reduce animal suffering; I can easily live healthily without killing conscious creatures for food) and environmental concerns (mainly regarding climate change: eating meat is a lot less energy-efficient than eating plants, rain forest is sacrificed to keep cattle herds; but also miscellaneous concerns, e.g. antibiotics use in factory farming increases the prevalence of superbugs)"

Omnivore,its tasty
Vegan,"It helps cut down my carbon footprint, I hate the way factory farming treats animals, and I just physically feel better eating a vegan diet."
Vegetarian,"1)For healthier living
2) To hopefully reduce fibroid risk as it runs in my family"
Omnivore,Convenience
Omnivore,"My diet is a mix of vegetarian and omnivore, and the reason I still eat some meat/dairy is because vegetarianism is difficult in a country where all national cuisine has some form of animal product in it."

Omnivore,"I try to limit my animal products in my diet, but also enjoy eating animal product foods, and enjoy trying a variety of restaurants and don't want to wast free foos, too much to completely stop"
Vegan,"Veganism isn’t just a diet, it is about reducing the least amount of harm possible for the animals and environment. Also to improves one’s health and to help reduce the starvation of people. Veganism is a lifestyle, not just about food, as it involves choices of clothing and other items around."
Omnivore,"I do my best to maintain a balanced diet, and I like to include meat as a protein at least once a day."
Vegetarian,Ethical reasons - I don't want to eat any animals because they're living beings and I'm disgusted by the thought of eating a corpse
Omnivore,"I enjoy both fruit, vegetables and meat. It is what I grew up eating."
Omnivore,I like it and would find it really hard to give up meat I think.
Omnivore,"I like eating meat and I need to, to get enough protein and iron"
Omnivore,"In no order:
Easy, balance, cost, taste"
Omnivore,It’s what I grew up on and I haven’t found “my” reason to become vegan easily yet
Omnivore,"I have difficulty keeping on weight, and it's generally easier to make sure I get enough calories and protein if I eat meat. I also just generally don't have any moral qualms with eating meat so I don't really see a reason not to. I don't have the energy or time or motivation to carefully figure out how to make sure I still get all the nutrients and fat and protein I need without any meat. Vegetarian and vegan diets tend to be in my opinion more expensive and more difficult to balance."
Vegetarian,I was raised vegetarian due to my mom's religion (but I am not religious).
Omnivore,tradition in my family
Omnivore,I'm in recovery from anorexia nervosa
Vegetarian,"I personally eat healthier on a plant based diet, but giving up all dairy is increasingly difficult when spending more time with friends or family. I mainly avoid meat because it makes my stomach hurt and makes me feel bloated."
Omnivore,I don’t have any strong reasons morally or health wise to eat otherwise.
Vegan,"Mostly vegan. Vegetarian since in was 8 years old as I was/am a fussy eater, didn't like much meat and was constantly being told 'Either be vegetarian or eat meat, you can't pick and choose and being fussy'. Animal products have decreased throughout the years with periods of full veganism, however it has made me lose a lot of weight in the past so have then reverted to vegetarianism. An eating disorder probably influenced my food choices in different ways (binging, including dairy products and restricting dairy products. Learnt a lot about my ethics and nowadays supermarkets and food establishments make it so easy to be plant based, there really isn't any excuse. So much better for the environment and my health too."
Vegetarian,Turned off meat over a decade ago.
Omnivore,No strong feelings about veganism
Omnivore,"I exercise a lot (lifting and martial arts) and as much I would enjoy a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, it would be difficult for me to get the right amount of nutrients."
Omnivore,"I like meat, despite being very aware of the negative global environmental affects of the industry. But, at the end of the day there is virtually no ethical consumption under late stage capitalism."

I’m a professional athlete with iron and B12 deficiencies along with lactose intolerance, so vegetarianism/veganism doesn’t work for me"
Vegetarian,"Health

Omnivore,"Fat Loss, mental clarity, reduce inflammation"
Omnivore,I enjoy eating a variety
Omnivore,Full nutritional variety.
Omnivore,Enjoy a wide range of foods
Vegetarian,Just because
Omnivore,"Having suffered from an eating disorder for over eight years (initially diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa in 2010, diagnosis changed to Anorexia Nervosa in 2016), I am reluctant to place further restrictions on my diet. I am currently in recovery- I have been fully weight restored for 9 months and am now only rarely using disordered behaviours. However, I am aware of the effect that dietary restriction has on me- any concrete rules around food tend to trigger cravings and binge/purge behaviour, and any dietary rules I put in place tend to become more rigid and restrictive over time. I think it would be very easy for disordered restriction to sneak back in under the disguise of healthy, ethical exclusion of food groups, and this is not a risk I am currently willing to take.
I have known many people who have become vegan during their recovery from an eating disorder, and have felt that in the majority of cases (though certainly not in all) the new rules and restrictions of veganism have replaced the rules and restrictions of their eating disorder, whether or not the individual concerned has been aware of this. Some acquaintances have become vegan with the conscious intent to use this to control their diet (as veganism excludes many food items with high fat or calorie content e.g. cheese, many baked goods, milk chocolate etc) and use lower calorie alternatives (e.g. soya or almond milk instead of dairy). I have also known people who genuinely believe that they are making a healthy choice by becoming vegan (either during their eating disorder or their recovery), but whose devotion to veganism has uncomfortably mirrored their previous devotion to their ED driven rules and rituals; as a result, food and their diet remains the central focus of their lives. At this point in my recovery I do not feel that I would be able to be completely honest with myself about my intentions if I were to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet."

Omnivore,Easy to follow Variety of options
Vegan,"Veganism is not a diet its a value system (will elaborate below) plant based is a diet (will elaborate below) that aligns with the values of veganism.

Plant based diet:

The largest studies on human nutrition and disease ever conducted have all concluded that a whole foods plant based diet is not only the healthiest diet for humans but it also prevents and even reverses the biggest diseases and causes of death in the West (14 out of the 15 top diseases in the West are caused or worsened by animal products) the required amount of animal products humans need is zero. Look into ""The China Study"" as a start.

Veganism:

Veganism is an emergent value system in an emergent universe; its a value system that is focused on ever decreasing the human impact on earth and it starts with removing all animal products from ones diet and lifestyle choices for the following reasons:

Over 60 billion land animals are raised, confined, mutilated, tortured, seperated and then murdered for food that is making humans sick and is now the leading cause of death in the west.

Over 500 billion sea life are killed each year with many being ""by products"" i.e. dolphins and sharks and turtles being caught in large fishing nets.

99% of all land animals are raised in factory farms where animals are treated worse than the worst criminals in the world. Animals are confined in cages inside factories their entire lives, they are mutilated as they go insane and try and eat each other, they are often boiled alive in scalding tanks which remove hair because the rate these animals are killed is faster than they bleed to death. Pigs in australia are gassed to death.. sound familar?

Because over 60 billion land animals are raised and killed each year the animal agriculture industry is the main cause of all environmental destruction and climate change.. even if we completely changed our power and transport systems we will still destroy the environment and ourselves at this rate.

Animal agriculture is the main cause of:

Deforestation
Water pollution
Habitat destruction 
Species extinction
Climate change

Animal agriculture is also the main consumers of antibiotics.. as animals are so sick in their cages that they are drugged.. people who eat animal products are becoming unable to use antibiotics.

The animals people are eating are making them sick and new drugs and treatments are teated on animals when the solution is to juat stop eating them.

Farm animals such as pigs are smarted than human children, smarter than dogs, and we torture them for life and murder them for 5 minutes of selfish pleasure.

""If animals ever formulated a religion, the devil would be depicted in human form""

""To animals, all humans are nazis"""

Omnivore,Its a cultural lifestyle. I eat whatever I like and have seen my family eat (or not eat).

Omnivore,I was raised an omnivore and i love eating everything. Also i am naturally very skinny so i think that if i became vegan or vegetarian i would get sick

At this point, I don't care too much but it has been five years so I stick with it for a few reasons: spite toward everyone who called it a phase, guilt that I feel whenever I seriously consider stopping, and because my body no longer knows how to process meat. I've gotten terrible stomach cramps every time I accidentally consume meat (including things made with animal broth). So it's just not worth it to stop."
Omnivore,"I do not like to follow this diet as I know it is unhealthy for me but I follow this diet because it is the most common diet being cooked in our country and apparently, there is no vegan restaurant here in my country that I know of. I tend to shift to being vegan but my whole family does not follow vegan diet therefore, i fall back to 
 the diet with mostly meat on it (because of ""eat what is served"")."

Omnivore,"I enjoy eating a broad variety of food including meat
"
Omnivore,"Grew up on a farm, meat always available and slow stews taste great. I'm not growing anymore or ever going to menstruate so I could cut down on the meat consumption...  But I don't because I'm prone to low iron and supplementation of any sort is not my preference. I'm aware of the WHO statement on red meats but take it along with the fact too much of anything can be a bad thing. A varied diet of unprocessed foods is my ideal. I wouldn't consider a strict vegan diet because of how restrictive it would be on gatherings with family/friends."

Vegetarian,I don't like the flavour/texture of meat
